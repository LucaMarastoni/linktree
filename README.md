# Simple Linktree Alternative

This project is a lightweight and free alternative to Linktree. It allows you to create a simple personal page with links to your profiles, websites, or any other destinations.

## Features
- Profile picture displayed at the top of the page.
- Your name displayed prominently below the profile picture.
- Three customizable buttons with icons and text for your links.
- A privacy policy popup to comply with basic website requirements.
- Fully responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works
1. **HTML Structure:**
   - The `index.html` file contains the main structure of the webpage.
   - It includes:
     - A section for your profile picture and name.
     - Three customizable link buttons with text and icons.
     - A button to open a privacy policy popup.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - The `styles.css` file handles the visual appearance of the page.
   - Features include:
     - Rounded profile picture with a thin border.
     - Clean and modern button design.
     - Smooth hover and click animations for buttons.
     - A popup with an animation for the privacy policy.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - JavaScript adds interactivity:
     - Opening and closing the privacy policy popup.
     - Clicking outside the popup closes it.

4. **Customization:**
   - Replace `foto_profilo.jpg` with your own profile picture.
   - Update the links and text in the HTML to point to your personal or professional sites.
   - Add or remove buttons as needed by editing the `index.html` file.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Replace the default profile picture (`foto_profilo.jpg`) with your own.
3. Edit `index.html`:
   - Update the name displayed below the profile picture.
   - Change the links and button labels to suit your needs.
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see your page.
5. (Optional) Host the page on a free service like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
